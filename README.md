Ransomware is a secure temporary e-mail service. This means that it lets you have a private e-mail address that anyone can send e-mail to.
The e-mail and the address both self-destruct in 10 minutes, so you don't have to worry about SPAM or anything like that.
RansomWare allows you to easily give an e-mail address that won't exist in 10 minutes, so there's no risk of SPAM.
If the website makes you verify the e-mail address by sending you a link to your e-mail that you have to click, then you can read the e-mail 
right here on RansomWare Extension and click on the link.
